Xdebug (PHP Debugger) client written in JavaScript
==================================================

This project includes:

  * An implementation of the [DBGP Protocol](http://www.xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php):
    * Can run in the browser and on the server.
  * An intelligent [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) based *DBGP* proxy server:
    * Expose an async *DBGP* interface to the browser via [socket.io](http://socket.io/).
    * Control *Xdebug* from the server, the browser or both at the same time.
  * A *Xdebug* client library that connects to *Xdebug* directly or to the proxy server.
  * A client UI showing events as they are executed used for development and testing.

NOTE: Only the core *DBGP* features are implemented at this time.


Usage
=====

Requirements
------------

  * [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) & *npm*
  * Webserver with *PHP* support
  * [PHP 5.2+ / 7.0+](http://php.net/) *cli* and *webserver* support
  * [Xdebug 2.2+](http://www.xdebug.org/) (see [Xdebug Install](http://www.xdebug.org/docs/install))

Install
-------

    git clone git://github.com/jasny/lib-phpdebug-js.git
    cd lib-phpdebug-js
    npm install

Setup
-----

Create a *virtual host* with *PHP* enabled and *Xdebug* installed (say `http://lib-phpdebug.localhost/`) and 
point it to `./php/`. This will be used to serve PHP scripts for the example client UI and automated tests.

Configure *Xdebug* in *php.ini*:

    xdebug.remote_enable=1
    xdebug.idekey=secret-key
    xdebug.remote_port=9000         // default
    xdebug.remote_host=localhost    // default
    xdebug.remote_autostart=0       // default

Launch debug proxy server:

    node ./example/server --port 9080 --php lib-phpdebug.localhost --idekey secret-key

Use `-v` to log major events to console and `-d` to log debug messages to console.

Test
----

The following will run a bunch of tests to cover all supported use-cases:

    node ./test/all --port 9080 --php lib-phpdebug.localhost --skip-browser-tests --idekey secret-key

TIP: If the example client is open at `http://localhost:9080/` it will show the progress of
the tests if the `--skip-browser-tests` argument is omitted.

Demo
----

Open the example client at `http://localhost:9080/` (served from the debug proxy server).

You can now use the client to run the test suite using the `Run All Tests` link.
