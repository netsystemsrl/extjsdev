 * Purpose of this module:
 * 
 *   A [Xdebug](http://www.xdebug.org/) client that connects to Xdebug directly
 *   (for use on server) or to the debug proxy server (for use in browser).
 *   
 *   Provides all the wrapping to make `./dbgp` usable on server and in browser
 *   and abstracts the [DBGP Protocol](http://www.xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php) to
 *   hide low-level connection and session logic.
 *
